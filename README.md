<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

As this is just frontend of application, you can try out all of the features just by creating fake accounts which will be kept in RAM until you stop the app.

Try logging in as admin with username: mail@mail.com, and password: password

From here you can create user account for your employees(sellers), add some products, their description, photo, price, and then log out and try to add those products to chart and place an order.

After that log back in as seller using seller account you created earlier and verify order you just placed.
